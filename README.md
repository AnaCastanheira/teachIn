# TeachIN'
This project was developed by a team of five people in a 24 hour `hackhaton` project, for the third and last round of group projects @ <Academia de Codigo_>'s bootcamp#29, taking place by the end of the 12th week of code learning.

## The project Idea
Creating an web application that serves as repository for methodologies to help teach mentally ill students.


## Methodologies
Agile
SCRUM
REST

## Tecnologies
Java
Javascript
JQuery

## Build the server
Use maven `$ mvn tomcat7:deploy` to deploy the project to your local tomcat service.
Tomcat should be configured for `localhost:8080` - if not, please update project files.

## Run the client side
open the index.html in any browser and you should be good to go.
